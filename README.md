# MouseShimmy

An application to move the mouse cursor naturally to random positions on the screen, at random intervals, to keep the computer in an active state.

## Installation

If you just download the release from the Releases page, you can extract the MouseShimmy.rar file and run MouseShimmy.exe directly. This is just the precompiled binary and required supporting files, the same you would get compiling it yourself.

----

Alternatively, if you plan to build yourself from source, you can either download the source from this page, or clone it directly with Git:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LazySmurf/MouseShimmy
  cd MouseShimmy
```

Then, you can build the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C#.NET compiler

## Usage

To use MouseShimmy, simply run the executable to start the application. Then, you can hide the program to tray if you wish, you can click the mouse icon to show it again. Alternatively, pressing F10 will toggle showing or hiding the window. 

To start the program, you can click the “Activate” button or press F8. Clicking “Deactivate” or pressing F8 again will stop the mouse movements. 

## Requirements

Built using C# with .NET 9.0 — 
[Get .NET 9.0 Desktop Runtime from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

If you’re running the latest version of Windows, you may already have this runtime installed. Older versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 may or may not support this runtime at all.
